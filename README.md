# conway's game of life in cpp

hola this is charan im bored today so i want to make a cool cli thingy that looks good
so i wanted to iplement the conway's game of life check it out 
[here](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
- it is made in cpp (cuz thats what i know)
- dont judge me based on my dumb programming choices (im turing complete too!!)

------
> notes

1. the terminal rendering is kinda scrap
2. didnt make a interface to choose the live positions (will make it soon)
3. used some unconventional yet easy tricks like ANSI escape sequences for hiding cursor and stuff
4. it uses windows cls function for clearing the terminal (so win32 API is necessary ) ps:you can get rid of it by using a ANSI sequence 

------
another ps:
im on windows because my arch linux kernel broke 2 days before,not because im a noob(iam)
